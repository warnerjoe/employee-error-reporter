# Employee-Error-Reporter
This is some Javascript that is connected to a set of view-only Google Sheets which allows the various employees of an organization to see their portion of an error reporting log but nobody else's.

**Link to project:** 
I created a sample version of the project, but all of the data in it is sample data.

Entry Spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15rIDZ-VYblrNosTPk_YLZJhKEsBNvqcwd2heYewsQqE/edit?usp=sharinghttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15rIDZ-VYblrNosTPk_YLZJhKEsBNvqcwd2heYewsQqE/edit?usp=sharing

ANAME Viewing Spreadsheet: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GOxSXCkW-tvHIiwxKZF898UrTz1sz0wZ1xJ3yzGPo4g/edit?usp=sharing

**How to Use Demo**


In order to use this how it functions, you will need to click File and Make a Copy of both spreadsheets.  

All of the Javascript function will be in a "Script" menu at the top of the Google Sheet, next to "File, Edit, ..., Help".

The most simple use case is to click Script and "Copy Rows" and it will distribute the error reports to the appropriate people.  You can view them in the tabs at the bottom.  Once you've distributed your new entries, click Script and then delete the row's contents!

On the ANAME Viewing Spreadsheet's copy, you will need to click in Cell A1 and Allow Permissions.  You will only be able to see ANAME's content.

There are a few things it is impossible to recreate in a live demo, mainly disabling certain parts of the Spreadsheets to certain users.  If I did this, you would not be able to see everything.  

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** Javascript, Google Sheets Scripting

This project, developed for my professional role, streamlines error reporting via Google Sheets. It minimizes the time supervisors spend distributing error reports to employees, enhancing overall efficiency.

## Optimizations

I refactored several functions to create more specialized versions, improving the application's troubleshooting process.

## Lessons Learned:

With a Javascript base, I developed this project using Google's documentation and learned their custom syntax for creating automated functions for your Google Sheet.

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
